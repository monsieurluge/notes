# notes

Personal static notes and knowledge base using [Memex](https://github.com/kormyen/memex).

## Constraints

By design the content is stored in a human readable flat file, `/content/data.ndtl`, and is intended to be edited in a text editor. This is to keep the system simple and to avoid the need for a database or other complex setup. By extension, no compilation or build step is required to generate the site which uses only static files.

The file format is called [Indental](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#indental) and was created by Devine Lu Linvega, the programmer and artist of the [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html) collective.
